Ok this code does a whole lot of nothing as is. Go to 
https://www.idolondemand.com/
Find your api key, append something like 
&apikey=YOURAPIKEYHERE';
to line 7 of requestHandlers.js and then the server will work out how
4chan/a/ feels about life. Querying the server in about the first 4 seconds will make it crash.

DISCLAIMER: This code is not entirely, not even mostly, my own. This website provides a very basic nodejs server:
http://www.nodebeginner.org/
that I took and edited to make it do what I wanted.
